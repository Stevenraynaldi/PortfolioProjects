# PortfolioProjects
The Portfolio Projects are a series of exercises that I take to improve my data analysis skills. Beginning with data exploration, I will be moving on to data cleaning and then eventually data visualisation. 

Data Exploration
In this project, I am exploring data relating to covid-19 from Jan 2020 to May 2022.
The exploration revolves total cases, total deaths and vaccination number around the globe and Singapore.

Data Cleaning
The data I am using is a random data sample but this exercise focuses more on the different data cleaning techniques that I can employ.
